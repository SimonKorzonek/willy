WILLY

I started up with super simple AI chatbot. After attempt to train it on huge pack of reddit data and failing, I decided to apply a rule-based virtual assistant funcionalities it. Utilizes Google Calendar API. Video presenting his possibilities is on it's way.
Used technologies

- Python

- Tensorflow & TFlearn

- Google Calendar API

- Python text to speech & Google speech recognition
Functionalities

Chatbot - It doesn't know much more than who he is, who made him, and that he's great. Trained on small custom-made .json file.

Calendar reminder - If Willy catches date in what he heard, he checks if there are any upcoming events at this date in connected google calandar.

Program opener - He can also run executables, with paths he knows. "Open program" in input sentence triggers this logic.

Note saver - He can save .txt notes from your voice into app directory. "Create note" in input sentence triggers this logic
